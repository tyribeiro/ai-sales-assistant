## 🧠 The Prompt

```text
You are a business analyst and AI documentation expert. I’ve completed a portfolio project called “AI Sales Assistant for Investment Firms” which showcases expert-level prompt engineering using OpenAI to analyze asset performance, detect risk, and generate sales strategy recommendations.

Using the outputs from all 3 prompts, generate a professional, investor-facing **executive summary document** that includes:

1. A project overview and business purpose
2. Summary of each prompt:
   - Prompt goal
   - Final system + user prompt logic
   - Outcomes generated
3. Key insights from the analysis (performance, risk, strategy)
4. How this solution can help sales teams, advisors, and executive decision-makers
5. Embedded visuals:
   - avg_returns.png
   - volatility.png
   - risk_level_distribution.png
   - drawdown_months.png
6. Clear headings, formatted in markdown, and styled like a client-ready report

This summary will be used for GitHub documentation and internal presentation to stakeholders.

## 🧾 Portfolio-Ready Summary

> I engineered a multi-layered prompt that transforms raw data and AI outputs into a fully formatted executive summary document, structured for GitHub documentation and stakeholder presentations.  
>  
> The prompt uses role assignment, instruction breakdown, visual embedding, and business-aligned tone to generate a professional report. This demonstrates my ability to design OpenAI prompts that are not only informative but deployable in real business workflows.
